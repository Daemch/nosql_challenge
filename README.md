Eat Safe, Love, is a food magazine that has contracted me to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists 
and food critics decide where to focus future articles. Specifically, they want you know, which locations they wish to visit and avoid, based primarily on 
food hygiene score issued from the UK Food Standards Agency.

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. 
The magazine editors have some requested modifications for the database before you can perform any queries or analysis for them. 

The magazine has asked to include an exciting new halal restaurant just opened in Greenwich, but hasn't been rated yet. 

The magazine has also asked for the removal of any establishments within the Dover Local Authority from the database.
